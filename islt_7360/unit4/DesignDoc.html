    <h1>Katelyn Lloyd's Design Document</h1>
    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        <p>Pigs and Prints’ purpose is to showcase graphic t-shirt designs to acquiring customers.  
            Our website will showcase specific designs to viewers who wish to inquire about the design in further detail.  
            Our categories are designed to help viewers easily navigate the website to find what they are looking for.  
            In the event that a viewer is unable to find their desired design, we have provided a Custom area for the view to submit design requests. 
             Our mission is to provide each viewer with their graphic tee needs at the convenience of their home.  
        </p>
    <h3>Use Cases:</h3>
        <h4>Case 1:</h4>
        <h4>Case 2:</h4>
        <h4>Case 3:</h4>
    <h3>Audience:</h3>
        <p>The target audience for this webpage will primarily be women ranging in age from 14 to 60 plus.  
            This does not limit men from visiting the website, however the content is generally designed for ladies.  
            It does not matter where the viewer is from nor what they do for a living.  The content does have limiting hobbies 
            such as farm attire, football gear, and animals.  However there is still broad categories that would appeal to anyone 
            such as seasonal wear and quotes.  I will still have a custom design function that will allow users to submit their own 
            which will appeal to all audience members.  Users must have the internet to view this site.

    <h3>Needs Assessment:</h3>
        <p>To determine what viewers are interested in for a graphic t-shirt website, 
            I polled a select group of individuals.  All questions required a short answer response 
            and were asked directly to the person in order to avoid bias. 
        </p>
            <h4>Questions</h4>
                <ol>
