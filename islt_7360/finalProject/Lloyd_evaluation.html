    <h1><b>Katelyn Lloyd's Website Evalution Report</b></h1>

    <h2>Evaluator A</h2>
        <p>
            Evaluator A is Claire.  Claire is my sister and has a degree in business.  Her background in marketing makes her a creditble source
            and approaches the evaluation with a different eye.  The operating system she used was a MacBook Air and Google Chrome via cable modem/wireless.  
        </p>
    
    <h2>Evaluator B</h2>
        <p>
            Evaluator B is Sydney.  Sydney is currently a college student from my alma matter.  This puts her in one of my user case categories.
            Sydney also has some experience with graphic design as well as html.  She approaches this evaluation with a different eye than most. 
            Sydney viewed the website with a Macbook Pro, 13 inch with Retina screen display.  She used Google Chrome and was corporate/instiutional internet.
        </p>
    
    <h2>Evaluator C</h2>
        <p>
           Evaluator C is Lindsay.  Lindsay is an extended family member who knows a lot about my t-shirt designs.  She is also a teacher and a mother.
           She views the website as a user rather than the semantics behind the site.  Her input is what many other users would think and feel.  
           She visited the website using a Microsoft Surface Pro, 7th Gen Intel Core Processor, Intel Core m3 / 128GB SSD / 4GB RAM.  She viewed the webiste via
           Firefox and cable modem.  
        </p>

    <h2>Evaluator D</h2>
        <p>
            Evaluator D is Melissa.  Melissa is a teacher at the school where I work.  However, she has also taken an introductory web design class and is 
            familiar with HTML and CSS.  She is able to look at the site as a customer and a web designer.  Melissa used a Dell Inspirion 10, 2.20 GHz, 6 GB RAM 
            to visit the website.  She visited by using a wireless router and Google Chrome.  
        </p>

    <h2>Summary of Evaluation Responses</h2>
        <p>
            Evaluator A and B commented on the making the images of the designs the same size. Evaluator B phrased it by saying it would elminate bias towards
            a particular design.  Evaluator B also suggested having a font that is less generic.  This will help users remember the website instead of associating it with work.
            All four evlauators gave great suggestions on the navigation bar. Evaluator D suggested having fewer links with broader categories.  This would provide
            opportunities to grow with other media. This would then result in a t-shirt link that would include a sub-nav bar of the categories.  Evaluator C suggested 
            incorporating a link to the name of the shirt that provides users to purchase.  This would give them a direct way to request a design rather than returning to 
            the home page.  Evaluator C liked how the images were able to open in another window to view them better, however it was suggested that there be information 
            about the true size of the design.  This will provide viewers with a better understanding of how large the desing will be.  See the table below for the 
            average responses to the evaluation.

    <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of the website is to display graphic t-shirt prints to viewers who wish to purchase a shirt.  The site also provides a custom feature 
            as well as information about the shirts.  My use cases were the following: 
            <br>
            Case 1:
            <br>
            A teacher is interested in obtaining a seasonal tee to wear to school during the fall. The teacher would be able to click on the banner at the top 
            of the page that displays the “Seasonal” tab to be able to browse all of the designs that are related to fall. Of the websites that I looked at Matty 
            and Lux and Strong Girl Clothing both had categories specifically for the seasons located in their banner. However, after looking at the sites further, 
            The Blue Rose Sky had a seasonal collection. It was listed under a different category.
            <br>
            Case 2:
            <br>
            A college student looking for a unique graphic t-shirt to represent their college or favorite sports team. The student would be able to navigate 
            the banner at the top of the homepage and click on the “Game Day” tab. This will allow the student to browse all designs that are related to teams 
            and sports. Of the websites that I looked at, Matty and Lux and The Blue Rose Sky had a sports category. However, both were located under a different 
            tab and not explicitly mentioned on the homepage banner. My site will provide a direct link from the banner to the “Game Day” section.
            <br>
            Case 3:
            <br>
            A mother is having a birthday party for her son turning 1. She would like have a custom shirt made for his party. This way his outfit will match 
            the theme of the party. The mother navigates the banner at the top of the page to the “Custom Design” button. She will be directed to a form that 
            she will fill out. This form will ask her for information to contact her and for her design request. None of the websites that I found had a custom 
            feature. I feel as though this is something different that provides customers with what they want.
            <br>
            <br>
            These connected to my pilot site due to the categories I have provided in my navigation bar.  Case 1 is able to view the seasonal designs of fall at the 
            moment.  As we approach Halloween and Thanksgiving, there will be designs added to incorporate more of the fall season.  Case 2 is able to be supported due 
            to the "Game Day" link.  These shirts are all associated sports attire in some way.  These are also customizable to the school of choice if a school name is 
            present.  Case 3 is supported through the "Custom Design" link.  This link is still a work-in-process.  This is still be supported on the site, however 
            there are going to be some changes made due to the content that I thought would be able to be displayed.  I will be including a link to email custom designs 
            rather than filling out a form.
        </p>

    <h2>Planned Changes</h2>
        <h3>Image Sizes</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                I plan on making the images sizes all the same.  This came from Evaluator A, B, and C's comments.  I am doing this because I think it will 
                allow the size to appear cleaner and more organized.This will benefit the site by providing a more simplistic view and allow the images 
                to all be uniformed.  This will not create any bias towards a design. 
            </p>

        <h3>Font Type</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                I will not be changing the type of font addressed by Evaluator B.  This is due to limited fonts avalible for coding html.  I do not have the 
                experience of implementing outside fonts that are not accessible on all users' computers.  
            </p>

        <h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                I plan adjusting the navigation bar.  I would like to experiment with broader categories and creating sub-categories within.  This would allow me 
                separate the "Custom Design &amp; Information" link to be two seperate links in the navigation bar. This was suggested by Evaluator B and D.  If this 
                does not work out, I will be adjusting the navigation bar to show you which link you are currently on.  This was suggested by Evaluator A. This will 
                benefit the website by allowing users to always know where they are. It will simplify the site even more. 
                <br>
                I will also be adding to the "Information" link external links on vinyl colors and types.  I will also be adding a link to washing and drying 
                instructions as well as FAQ.
            </p>
        
        <h3>Design Size</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                Evaluator C suggested that the design be show in actual size.  To accomodate her suggestion, I will be incorporating a table in the "Information" link 
                to show the size of the design based on the size of the t-shirt.  This will be a generic table for the majority of the designs.  I will indicate this 
                near the table.  This will benefit the site by providing the users with more information.  The more that is available to them, the less questions they have 
                about requesting a purchase.
            </p>
        
        <h3>Link Under Image</h3>
            <p style="margin-left: 40px;">
                Evaluator C suggested have a link to request for purchase with each image.  I would like to add this to the description under each image as well as 
                it being on the "Home" page.  This will allow the user to immediate notify what they are interested in and they wouldn't have to leave the page. This will 
                benefit the site by allowing the views to not have to switch between pages.  They are able to click on the design they like and not have to leave the page. 
                This will simplify the site even further. 
            </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            The evaluation process was very beneficial process for me.  It really helped me with making sure my Pilot site was where it needed to be in terms of my 
            final project.  I think that posting the pilot site to the discussion board was more beneficial for me in terms of the details of the site.  This allowed 
            others within the class to look at a site with a different view-point and share what they have learned in terms of HTML and CSS.  They were also able to 
            catch any mistakes that had been made along the way.  On the other hand, I did still benefit from the evaluations that I gave to four people.  This allowed 
            me to see how outsiders would interpret the site.  I was able to get honest feedback about the design elements.  This will help with the overall product of 
            the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was able to learn that the organization of the site means more to people than some of the overall features.  It is important that the functionality is 
            simple to use to viewers. It is also important to have cleans lines for easy flow and simple sight lines.  I learned that conducting a formative evaluation 
            provides you with a break from your site and allows others to notice details that you've been use to seeing.  In the long run, this benefits the overall 
            outcome of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was glad I chose to have four evaluators.  This provided me with a greater range of knowledge and backgrounds to evaluate the website.  I was able to 
            receive feedback on all aspects of my website.  The details, the coding, the overall look, and style were all touched upon by my evaluators.  This will 
            allow me to make the proper changes to have a well put together final product that will not only look great, but function at the its highest potential.
        </p>
