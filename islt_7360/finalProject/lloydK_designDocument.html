    <h1>Katelyn Lloyd's Design Document</h1>
    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
        <p>Pigs and Prints’ purpose is to showcase graphic t-shirt designs to acquiring customers.  
            Our website will showcase specific designs to viewers who wish to inquire about the design in further detail.  
            Our categories are designed to help viewers easily navigate the website to find what they are looking for.  
            In the event that a viewer is unable to find their desired design, we have provided a Custom area for the view to submit design requests. 
             Our mission is to provide each viewer with their graphic tee needs at the convenience of their home.  
        </p>
    <h3>Use Cases:</h3>
        <h4>Case 1:</h4>
            <p>
                A teacher is interested in obtaining a seasonal tee to wear to school during the fall.  
                The teacher would be able to click on the banner at the top of the page that displays the 
                “Seasonal” tab to be able to browse all of the designs that are related to fall.  Of the websites that I 
                looked at <a href=" https://mattyandlux.com/"> Matty and Lux </a> and <a href="https://stronggirlclothing.com/"> Strong Girl Clothing</a> both had 
                categories specifically for the seasons located in their banner.  However, after looking at the sites further, <a href="https://theblueroseky.com/">The Blue Rose Sky </a>
                had a seasonal collection.  It was listed under a different category. 
            </p>

        <h4>Case 2:</h4>
            <p>
                A college student looking for a unique graphic t-shirt to represent their college or favorite sports team.  
                The student would be able to navigate the banner at the top of the homepage and click on the “Game Day” tab.  
                This will allow the student to browse all designs that are related to teams and sports.  Of the websites that I looked at, 
                <a href=" https://mattyandlux.com/"> Matty and Lux </a> and <a href="https://theblueroseky.com/">The Blue Rose Sky </a> had a sports category.  However, both were located under a different tab and not explicitly 
                mentioned on the homepage banner.  My site will provide a direct link from the banner to the “Game Day” section.
            </p>

        <h4>Case 3:</h4>
            <p>
                A mother is having a birthday party for her son turning 1.  She would like have a custom shirt made for his party.  
                This way his outfit will match the theme of the party.  The mother navigates the banner at the top of the page to the 
                “Custom Design” button.  She will be directed to a form that she will fill out.  This form will ask her for information to 
                contact her and for her design request.  None of the websites that I found had a custom feature.  I feel as though this is 
                something different that provides customers with what they want.  

            </p>
    <h3>Audience:</h3>
        <p>The target audience for this webpage will primarily be women ranging in age from 14 to 60 plus.  
            This does not limit men from visiting the website, however the content is generally designed for ladies.  
            It does not matter where the viewer is from nor what they do for a living.  The content does have limiting hobbies 
            such as farm attire, football gear, and animals.  However there is still broad categories that would appeal to anyone 
            such as seasonal wear and quotes.  I will still have a custom design function that will allow users to submit their own 
            which will appeal to all audience members.  Users must have the internet to view this site.

    <h3>Needs Assessment:</h3>
        <p>To determine what viewers are interested in for a graphic t-shirt website, 
            I polled a select group of individuals.  All questions required a short answer response 
            and were asked directly to the person in order to avoid bias. 
        </p>
            <h4>Questions</h4>

                <li>Custom Design- This page will include a form for viewers to fill out to submit their request for a custom design.  
                    I will be able to contact them to confirm their request.

            </ul>

    <h3>Presentation of Information/Rationale of Organization:</h3>
        <p>
            The webpage will contain one home page and several supporting pages to provide viewers with the information they need to navigate the website.
        </p>
            <ul>

                            <li>Picture of Logo</li>

                <li><b>Supporting Pages:</b>These pages will provide users with their specific needs.  Users will be able to choose the category of design that they are looking
                                            for and be taken to a page of strictly those designs.</li>

        <p>
                The design and colors will be consistent throughout all pages. 
                Color choices will represent the feel of being on a farm in a barn. 
                A banner will be at the top of each page. Navigation buttons will be at the top of every page. 
                A link to the home page will also be provided at the top of each page.
        </p>
    <h3>Media:</h3>
            <p>I will be using all of my own images that I have created as designs for graphic tees.  
                Some are screen shots from Cricut Design Space and others are images that I have taken of completed shirts.  
            </p>
    <h3>Color Scheme and Rationale:</h3>
        <p>
            It is my vision to feel as though you walk into a barn when you enter my website.  I hope to keep the colors aesthtically pleasing to the eye.
            The background of this site will be the background of the webpage.  Click <a href= "images/colorScheme.png"> HERE</a> to view the entire color scheme.
